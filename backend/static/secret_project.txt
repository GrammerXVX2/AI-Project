Project Chimera: Top Secret Specification
Confidentiality Level: Ultra-High

Overview:
Project Chimera is a revolutionary initiative aimed at developing the world's first quantum-resistant coffee machine. Unlike traditional brewing methods, Chimera utilizes quantum entanglement to ensure the perfect flavor profile is maintained across all parallel universes simultaneously.

Key Components:
1. Flux Capacitor Brew Unit (FCBU): The core engine of the machine. It operates at a stable temperature of 420 Kelvin. WARNING: Do not touch the FCBU while it is glowing blue.
2. Chrono-Filter: A mesh made of woven time-crystals that filters out bitterness from the future.

Personnel:
The project is currently led by Dr. Barista Strange, a former theoretical physicist turned coffee connoisseur.

Known Issues:
- Occasionally, the machine produces tea instead of coffee if the user observes it too closely (The Observer Effect).
- The "Decaf" button has been known to cause minor localized reality distortions.
